# cs-cart-shopify
Cs-cart Shopify syncing addon

This is a couple of days of work to sync Cs-cart products to Shopify.

The products with variations will not work as it requires more work.

This code could be a good starting point for someone aiming to work at syncing products between Cs-cart and Shopify.
This scenario is useful is if a Cs-cart users wants to use shopify's POS(Point of Sale) system.

Download the folder as zip and intall from cs-cart admin backend.
You will need to set cs-cart api and shopify api credentials in app/addons/shopify/config.php

Feel free to contact me in case of any confusion.
